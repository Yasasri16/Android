# Jadx
While apktool focuses on decompiling dalvik bytecode to smali code, which is low-level language, jadx fouses on decompiling dalvik bytecode into java source code.

It provides a high-level, Java source code representation of the application's code, which is almost the original code.

## Commands 
`jadx -d <destination> <source_apk>` - To disassemble apk files.

#### Note : 
`We can't reassemble apk files using jadx.`
