# Android Application Fundamentals

## APK Structure : 

An APK is essentially a ZIP archive containing compiled code (classes.dex), resources, and the manifest file.

## DEX Bytecode : 

Android applications are compiled into DEX (Dalvik Executable) bytecode, which is executed by the Android Runtime.

## SMALI : 

A human-readable representation of DEX bytecode, useful for low-level analysis.

Getting Started with Reversing Android Apps
Exercise 1: Analyze a simple APK to understand its structure and identify the main activity.

Steps:

Use apktool to decompile the APK.

Examine the AndroidManifest.xml to find the entry point.

Use jadx to decompile classes.dex and analyze the Java code.

Exercise 2
Objective: Identify and extract a hardcoded flag from the APK.

Steps:

Decompile the APK using jadx.

Search for strings that resemble flags (e.g., flag{...}).

Locate the method where the flag is returned or compared.

Exercise 3
Objective: Understand control flow and logic to retrieve the flag.

Steps:

Analyze conditional statements and loops that process user input.

Trace the execution path that leads to the flag being displayed.

Modify the input accordingly to trigger the correct path.

Exercise 4
Objective: Deal with string obfuscation techniques.

Steps:

Identify methods that manipulate or decrypt strings.

Understand the obfuscation algorithm used.

Reverse the algorithm to retrieve the original strings.

Reverse Engineering Android Apps - Native Libraries
Exercise 5
Objective: Analyze a native library (.so file) to find the flag.

Steps:

Extract the native library from the APK (lib/ directory).

Use Ghidra to disassemble and analyze the native code.

Identify functions that process input and return the flag.

Exercise 6
Objective: Understand JNI (Java Native Interface) interactions.

Steps:

Locate native methods declared in Java code.

Analyze corresponding native functions in the .so file.

Trace how data is passed between Java and native code.

Exercise 7
Objective: Deobfuscate code to find the flag.

Steps:

Identify obfuscated class and method names.

Use jadx to decompile and analyze the code structure.

Rename classes and methods for clarity.

Trace the logic to locate the flag.
