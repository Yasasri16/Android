# Baby Android 1 

After installing and launching the app, the initial screen displayed a simple message:

`Too slow!!`

I decided to see the source code by decompiling the APK with JADX.

Inside the resources, I found the layout file activity_main.xml containing 28 TextView elements. 

Each TextView held a single letter, but the letters appeared scrambled and out of order. 

Because the layout used ConstraintLayout, we can't manually sit and figure out the positions.

To better understand the arrangement, I copied the entire layout XML and created a new project in Android Studio. 

After pasting the code into the projectâ€™s activity_main.xml, I opened the layout preview.

This allowed the letters to be displayed in their actual positions according to the constraints, which revealed the hidden flag clearly.

(b was at the top of the screen. I couldn't include it since I zoomed in)

Upon installing and launching the app, it asked me to enter a flag for sanity check.

I then opened jadx to view the source code.

In the `MainActivity`, we can see the follwoing snippet.

```java
if (FlagChecker.check(flagAttempt)) {
                    banner.setText("That's the right flag!!!");
                } else {
                    banner.setText("Nope! Try again if you'd like");
                }
```

Our input is being sent to the method `check` of `FlagChecker` class.

Navigating to FlagChecker class gave this crucial detail.

```java
 public static native boolean check(String str);

    static {
        System.loadLibrary("babyandroid");
    }
```
I decompiled `libbabyandroid.so` file using ghidra.

After seeing the code and what's happening to the input , I wrote a corresponding python script to find the valid input.

```python
secret = "bycnu)_aacGly~}tt+?=<_ML?f^i_vETkG+b{nDJrVp6=)="
flag = ""

for i in range(23):  
    index = (i * i) % 47
    flag += secret[index]

print(flag)
```

This gave the output as `byuctf{c++_in_an_apk??}` which passed the sanity check and is the flag.
