# Task 9 : Access Control Issues - Part 1

In this challenge, titled `Access Control Issues - Part 1`, the objective is to access API credentials that are displayed within the app. The app contains a button labeled `VIEW API CREDENTIALS`. When clicked, it directs the user to another screen where the credentials are shown.

However, our objective is to access these credentials from outside the application.

Upon reviewing the source code, we see that clicking the button sends an implicit intent with the action `jakhar.aseem.diva.action.VIEW_CREDS`.

From the manifest, we can confirm that the `APICredsActivity` is registered to handle this intent through the intent-filter.

This intent is then handled by another activity, `APICredsActivity.class`, which is responsible for displaying the sensitive API credentials.

Since the `APICredsActivity` is exposed through an implicit intent, thereâ€™s no restriction on which app or user can trigger it. This creates a significant access control vulnerability.

We can simply use ADB (Android Debug Bridge) to initiate the activity from outside the app. 

The required command is `adb shell am start jakhar.aseem.diva/.APICredsActivity`.

The core issue here is that **the API credentials are accessible via an implicit intent that can be triggered by any app or external entity, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information**. This exposes the credentials to potential interception by malicious actors.

The possible solution is **to switch to explicit intents**, where the target activity is clearly specified, ensuring that only the app itself can trigger the activity. Additionally, **implementing proper access control mechanisms**, such as authentication or permission checks, would ensure that only authorized users or apps can access sensitive data like the API credentials.
