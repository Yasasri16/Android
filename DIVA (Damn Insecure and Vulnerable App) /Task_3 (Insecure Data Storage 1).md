From the code, it is clear that the user entered data is being stored insecurely in Shared Preferences. Whenever the user enter the details in the app and click on save button, the details are automatically saved into the Shared Preferences.

The core issue here is that **the data is saved in plain text, making it easily accessible to anyone with access to the device â€” especially on rooted devices**. 

Storing data in plain text within the SharedPreferences is a security risk because attackers can easily read or modify stored data on rooted devices, leading to data leaks. Sensitive info like tokens or login states in plaintext can be exploited. 

The best possible solution is encrypting the data in Shared Preferences. Encrypting ensures data is securely stored and unreadable without proper keys, protecting against tampering and unauthorized access.
